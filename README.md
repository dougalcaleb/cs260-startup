# PARALLEL

An app for discovering quick connections using your photo library.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

So often you miss out on connections with people because you just don't know that it's something you have in common -- it just never comes up in conversation. But everyone loves taking photos at their favorite or most important places. Parallel quickly finds those connections by cross-referencing your photo library with others -- instantly finding connections you might have never discovered otherwise!

### Design

![Design image](design-mockup.png)

App Flow
- Pages include login/register, personal library, person search, and connect
- Bottom Navigation
- Mobile-first

Data flow
- Auth data stored in Atlas
- Photo storage in S3 bucket(s) (or possibly EFS)
- Search results handled by server
- Connect page is just the Personal Library page but using another person's data
- Metadata and location extraction/processing handled by 3rd-party API (Google)

### Key features

- Comparing photos with similar data with others
